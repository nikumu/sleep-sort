# Sleep sort

This is a collection of [Sleep sort](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms/Sleep_sort) implementations, on various languages.

The idea behind this project was inspired by a [post](https://www.threads.net/@yernar.amergaliyev/post/DDlMG5si9sV) on Threads by Yernar Amergaliyev.

This project showcases how unconventional techniques can be applied to solve sorting problems in a unique and lazily way.
